## Palmer Penguins Dataset

I used the Palmer Penguins Dataset package from RStudio to test data analysis with R.The Palmer Penguins Dataset is a set of observations for 3 species of penguins.

First we will load the packages that would be needed for this project:

```{r loading packages}
library("ggplot2")
library("skimr")
library("tidyverse")
library("palmerpenguins")
```

## Summary of Palmer Penguins Dataset

From dataset below it shows 344 observations of 3 different species of penguins, Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. The dataset has 8 sets of features for each record as below:

```{r}
summary(penguins)
skim_without_charts(penguins)
```
## Sample Penguin Dataset

Here we view the first 10 records of the dataset by using the **head()** function. Note there are also some records with missing values, NA.

```{r}
head(penguins,10)
```


## Plots

We want to find which species between the 3 is the largest, we use a scatterplot to map each record and separate them by species. From the graph below it shows that most **Gentoo** species are the largest:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=na.omit(penguins))+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g, color=species, shape=species))+
  labs(title="Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs. Flipper Length", subtitle="Sample of Three Penguin Species",
       caption="Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gormen")+
  annotate("text", x=220, y=3500, label="Gentoos are the largest")
```

We can also further dive deeper into the data by finding out where the 3 species live on the 3 different islands. From the grpah below, Adelie species live and roam around all the 3 islands while Gentoo and Chinstrap each live at Biscoe and Dream island respectively with no observation on other islands.

```{r}

ggplot(data=na.omit(penguins))+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g, color=species, shape=species))+
  labs(title="Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs. Flipper Length on Different Island", subtitle="Sample of Three Penguin Species",
       caption="Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gormen")+
  facet_wrap(~island)
```




This is just a simple analysis done on the Palmer Penguins dataset to get familiar with R. I find it very interesting on how easy R is to clean and visualize the data all in one place. Feel free to connect with me if you have any suggestions or comments!
